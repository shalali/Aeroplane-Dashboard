# Aeroplane-Dashboard

This was my advance programming project in which I had to create different dials that can be used to display data on an vehicle. I coded a custom made software component i.e. a java bean. My java bean was a display board that could be used to display important flight information to inform whether a flight is on schedule, delayed or cancelled.
